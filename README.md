# videoderify-API
This is the API for my video sharing platform: Videoderify 

### TODOS: 
- handle uploaded files from the client
- expose API only to the client's domain / implement API access (API keys or something)
- write an endpoint that will serve a series' episodes <br>(each episode will be requested individually from the cleint, parameter will be the episode's number)
- organise routes
